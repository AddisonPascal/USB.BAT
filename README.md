# USB.BAT
A slightly useful USB management system. 

# Crash reporting
If the program crashes, please send the crash report (DRIVE://USB_DAT\crashReport.log) to me for analysis. 
In some (rare) cases, the crash report will not exist. If it does not, please send the tmp file (DRIVE://USB_DAT\intLog.tmp). It is the same as the crash report except has not been renamed by the system.
MAKE SURE NOT TO OPEN THE PROGRAM UNTIL YOU HAVE DONE THIS. Thanks! Try not to close it using the X button.
